<h1>Client</h1>
<p>You can download the source code for the client here:
<a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium</a></p>
<p>To build, open a command line and type <code>ant</code>. You should be able to launch the
    executable jar like any other java application.</p>
<p>Click the plus button (or "Add Server"). If the server is running, enter the address and port of the server, as
well as a handle and a password (if required). Press connect. You should now
be able to send messages and receive messages. </p>
<p>Type a message in the message window and press enter to send.</p>
<p>Click the image button to open a file explorer to find and image to send. (Not fully implemented yet.)</p>
<p>The sidebar is a work in progress and doesn't fully respresent the data of the current server.</p>
<h1>Server</h1>
<p>You can download the source code for the server here:
<a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Server">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Server</a></p>
<p>To build, open a command line and type <code>ant</code>.
    You need to launch the server from the command line by
    using <code>java -jar Helium_Server.jar</code>.
<h2>Commands:</h2>
<p><b>make</b> - starts a new server. The server will ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Port to open</li>
    <li>Server Name</li>
    <li>Password entry?(Y/N)</li>
    <li>Password (if you answered yes above)</li>
    <li>Preset Server color (Program will prompt options)</li>
    <li>HEX Color code (if you answered no above)</li>
    <li>Custom Icon URL(Y/N)</li>
    <li>URL if you answered yes above</li>
</ul>
<p><b>shutdown</b> - stops the server.</p>
<p><b>help</b> - shows help text</p>
<p><b>edit</b> - change configurable options (name, color, icon)</p>
<h2>Known issues:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Messages containing a \n character may behave unpredicatably and crash the server.</li>
    <li>The server may crash if a client disconnects during the initial handshake.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Central Server</h1>
<p>The code for the central server is located here:
    <a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Central_Server">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Central_Server</a></p>
<p>You can run the central server as described above, but it will not be at the IP address
    that the client expects it to be at. Currently, we have no dedicated system that runs the
        central server full time. This will be fixed in the next sprint.</p>
