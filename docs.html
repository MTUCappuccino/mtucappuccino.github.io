<h1>Client</h1>
<p>You can download the source code for the client here:
<a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium</a></p>
<p>To build, open a command line and type <code>ant</code>. You should be able to launch the
    executable jar like any other java application.</p>
<p>Click the plus button (or "Add Server"). If the server is running, enter the address and port of the server, as
well as a handle and a password (if required). Press connect. You should now
be able to send messages and receive messages. You can also add a server by code if the server is
registered with the central server. Contact the server vendor for a join code.</p>
<p>Type a message in the message window and press enter to send.</p>
<p>Click the image button to open a file explorer to find and image to send.</p>
<p>You can click the sidebar button to view server information as well as the leave server button. The Edit
  handle button is not fully implemented server-side. This also is where you can change notification settings.</p>
  <p>To send an at-mention, type "@" followed by the handle of the user you want to mention. They
    will then be notified directly if they have at-mention notifications enabled</p>
<p>Clicking the Bookmarks button will open a list of all the bookmarked messages. Clicking the button
    again will go back to all of the messages. To bookmark a message, right click it and then click Bookmark</p><h2>Known issues:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If a server does not require a handle, occasionally the client freaks out.</li>
        <li>Sometimes if you attempt to rejoin a server or another server after failing
          to join a prior server, the password/handle screens will not appear. Restart the client to fix.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Server</h1>
<p>You can download the source code for the server here:
<a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Server">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Server</a></p>
<p>To build, open a command line and type <code>ant</code>.
    You need to launch the server from the command line by
    using <code>java -jar Helium_Server.jar</code>.
</p><h2>Commands:</h2>
<p><b>make</b> - starts a new server. The server will ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Port to open</li>
    <li>Server Name</li>
    <li>Password entry? (Y/N)</li>
    <li>Generate random password? (Y/N)</li>
    <li>Password (if you answered yes above)</li>
    <li>Preset Server color (Program will prompt options)</li>
    <li>HEX Color code (if you answered no above)</li>
    <li>Custom Icon URL(Y/N)</li>
    <li>URL if you answered yes above</li>
</ul>
<p><b>edit</b> - change one of the options set in <b>make</b> such as name, color, icon, password, etc.
The program will prompt for valid inputs and walk you through the process.</p>
<p><b>kick</b> - will ask for a handle and kick the user with that handle</p>
<p><b>names</b> - lists all the names of users currently online</p>
<p><b>register</b> - register this server with the central server. Currently not reversable</p>
<p><b>short code</b> - returns the 5 character code obtained in the register command</p>
<p><b>stats</b> - prints some stats about the server</p>
<p><b>shutdown</b> - stops the server.</p>
<p><b>help</b> - shows help text</p>
<h2>Known issues:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Messages containing a \n character may behave unpredicatably and crash the server.</li>
    <li>The server may crash if a client disconnects during the initial handshake.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the server crashes if you enter the wrong password several times</li>
</ul>
<h1>Central Server</h1>
<p>The code for the central server is located here:    <a href="https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Central_Server">https://github.com/MTUCappuccino/Helium_Central_Server</a></p>
<p>You can run the central server as described above, but it will not be at the IP address
    that the client and server expect it to be at.</p>
<p>We have a raspberry pi running the central server waiting for client and server connections.
  The servers can register with this server and will be provided with a 5 character code.
  This same server also services clients who wish to translate the code into a usable
  server URL and port.</p>
  <p>The central server was also intended to maintain a listing of publically available servers,
    but we did not get to implementing this feature.</p><div>
